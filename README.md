# Ultrasonic Mini Mosquito Repellent

This is a semester project for the Applied Physics course at Bahria University. Our goal is to create a compact, eco-friendly, and affordable mosquito repellent device using ultrasonic technology.

## 🧪 Project Description

The ultrasonic mosquito repellent works by emitting high-frequency sound waves (20–40 kHz) that are unpleasant for mosquitoes but safe and inaudible to humans. It aims to reduce reliance on harmful chemical repellents.

This device is ideal for small indoor areas and can be powered by batteries or USB. It's built using simple components including an ultrasonic transmitter, microcontroller, and a basic power circuit.

## 🔧 Components Used

- Ultrasonic Transmitter (Piezoelectric Buzzer)
- Arduino Nano / 555 Timer IC
- Breadboard or PCB
- Power source (Battery or USB)
- Jumper wires
- Plastic casing (optional)

## ⚙️ Features

- Emits ultrasonic waves that repel mosquitoes
- Portable and battery-powered
- Safe for humans and pets
- Low-cost and easy to assemble
